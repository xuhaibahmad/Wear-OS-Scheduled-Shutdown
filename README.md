# Wear OS Scheduled Power Off

This small utility is aimed at solving overnight battery draining of smart watches via scheduled shutdowns. Unfortunately, the only reason I had to write this app myself was because Android no longer allows applications to shutdown the device. Therefore, to be able to use this app, you will need a rooted device and provide root permissions the app.
